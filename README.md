# What's Updog.link?

Updog.link is an ad-free and open-source URL Shortener service that anyone can deploy and run.o

## Why does this exist?
Aside from being a free shortlink service with a _[sick](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sick)_ name, this project is a great intro to Infrastructure as Code and multiple cloud technologies. Also you get to have your own shortlink service.

## How do I run my own?
Deployment will take you about 10 minutes, start to finish, including reading the instructions.

Also, It's virtually free to run: Amazon's Free Tier supports up to a million API requests per month. That means you can serve one literal million requests with [Amazon's free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/pricing/).
